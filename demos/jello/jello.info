Simulates the dynamics of an elastic body in real-time.
.sk 1
The icosohedron is made of 13 masses (one at each
vertex and one more in the middle).  Each mass is
connected to its neighbors by springs.
.sk 1
These formulas are linearly iterated for each mass:
.color 200 100 255
v = v + a dt
p = p + v dt
.color 255 100 45
a is the acceleration vector
(the sum of the forces due to the springs,
walls, and gravity, divided by the mass),
v is the velocity vector,
p is the position vector.
