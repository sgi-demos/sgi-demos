The radiosity method is based on thermal engineering techniques for determining
the exchange of radiant energy between surfaces.  The method accurately computes
the global illumination within a scene consisting of diffusely reflecting
surfaces.  Unlike local illuminating methods such as Phong, the Radiosity method
takes the geometry and material properties into account when computing the
illumination at any given point.  Thus, effects such as shadows, indirect
lighting, and color bleeding are readily achieved.  The result is the
illumination of the environment independent of viewpoint, allowing realtime
walk-throughs after performing the initial illumination calculations.  This
interactive walk-through ability makes the Radiosity method well suited for
applications such as architecture, industrial design, and animation.

The Radiosity method computes an equilibrium energy balance for visible energy
in the environment.  To arrive at this equilibrium, the geometric relationships
between every pair of surfaces in the environment must be computed.  Once these
geometric relationships have been found, they are combined with the reflective
values for each surface as well as the the emission values of light sources to
form a large system of simultaneous equations.  For an environment consisting of
N surfaces an N by N matrix must be formed and solved.  This project has
exploited the power of the Silicon graphics workstation and graphics pipeline to
accomplish this in minutes rather than hours.
