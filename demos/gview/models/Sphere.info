This is a simple model of a sphere on a pillar in a room to
demonstrate the effects of radiosity calculations.
.sk 2
This model has 1072 polygons.  Notice how light bouncing off
the red and blue walls affects the surrounding grey walls
and sphere.  Also note the soft shadow cast on the wall
opposite the light source.  This program does not do the
radiosity calculations; it just displays the results of the
calculations
