Buttonfly is a user configurable, graphical, hierarchical menu.
.sk 1
The program displays a button or set of buttons.
Each button has a title.  When picked with the left mouse
button the buttonfly button either runs a shell script
(the blue buttons) or the button tumbles forward revealing
another set of buttons on the back (the purple buttons).

An optional set of actions are available for each button
through a pop-up menu brought up by holding the right
mouse button down.  These actions are user configurable,
but a standard set are available in the demo environment:
